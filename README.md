# Key Aspects of the Code:

## Loading and Inspecting Data:
-The dataset is loaded and inspected correctly with head(), describe(), and info() methods.

## Data Cleaning:
-Irrelevant features are dropped.
-Missing values are handled using SimpleImputer for both numerical and categorical features.
-Categorical features are converted to dummy variables.
-The training and test datasets are aligned in terms of features.

## Feature Scaling:
-Features are scaled using MinMaxScaler, which is essential for logistic regression models to perform well.

## Model Training and Evaluation:
-A logistic regression model is trained and evaluated.
-The accuracy and confusion matrix indicate perfect performance (1.0 accuracy) on the test set.

## Hyperparameter Optimization:
-GridSearchCV is used to find the best hyperparameters for the logistic regression model.
-The best hyperparameters and their corresponding accuracy are displayed.

## Accuracy and Confusion Matrix:
Both the logistic regression model and the optimized model achieved 100% accuracy on the test set.
